    "RICE PUDDING:",
    "Bring milk to a simmer slowly in a large pot over low heat.",
    "Add rice, keep simmering until rice is tender, stir every 3 min or so to prevent rice and/or milk burning at the bottom. This step takes approx 40 minutes.",
    "While the rice is simmering you can make the raspberry sauce and chop the almonds.",
    "When rice is tender and has thickened, remove from heat and let it cool slightly.",
    "Add vanilla sugar, sugar and almonds.",
    "Fold in whipped cream.",
    "Keep warm or chill before serving (we actually like the rice pudding warm... but some like it chilled. Either way works).",
    "Serve with raspberry sauce or warm cherry sauce.",
    "SAUCE:",
    "In medium sauce pan, place frozen raspberries and 2 Tablespoons of water, heat until thawed, add sugar and stir. Let simmer for approx. 3-5 minutes.",
    "Strain seeds (catching the juices/pulp over a bowl), discard seeds and put juices back in the sauce pan.",
    "Mix cornstarch with water and add to the sauce SLOWLY to thicken. You probably won't need all the mixture. This step can be omitted if you want a more natural and thinner sauce.",
    "Serve sauce warm."
