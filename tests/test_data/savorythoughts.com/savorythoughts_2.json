  "instructions": "prepare the brownies then bake\nMake the Brownie Layer: Melt butter and chocolate over medium low heat. Transfer the melted chocolate butter mixture to a large bowl. Whisk in sugar, then eggs one at a time. Next add the vanilla extract, espresso powder, Belans, and cocoa. It’s normal to see the mixture appear grainy. Finally, add the all-purpose flour. Lastly, whisk in the flour until there are no streaks. If you mix the brownies too much, they will turn out rough. Bake for 28-30 minutes or until just set.Set the oven to 350F. Spread butter on an 8x8 or 8x8x2 inch baking pan and line the bottom and edges with parchment paper. You should leave some extra parchment paper hanging over the edges of the pan so that you can easily remove the brownie later. The brownie is done when the surface or top layer no longer appears wet. The middle should also be set – when a toothpick is inserted, it should come out moist and fudgy with light crumbs, but liquid should not be visible.Prepare the Cookies: Dip Vienna fingers (or homemade lady fingers) quickly in cooled coffee (don’t let them get mushy) and layer them right on top of the cooled brownies. Set aside.\nlayer the tiramisu brownies and enjoy\nWhip the Mascarpone Cream: Beat mascarpone, powdered sugar, vanilla, and whipped cream form a light stiff peak topping. Spread evenly over the cookies.Refrigerate the layered brownie for a minimum of one hour, or until the topping has solidified.Finish with Cocoa Powder: When ready to cut and serve, remove the layered brownies by pulling out the parchment and being careful to not disrupt the brownie, then place it on a cutting board. Dust the top generously with cocoa powder.Slice & Enjoy: The layers look stunning when cut—fudgy bottom, coffee-soaked middle, creamy top.",
