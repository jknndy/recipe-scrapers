  "ingredients": [
    "3 cups bread flour",
    "1 ¼ teaspoons instant dry yeast",
    "2 teaspoons kosher salt",
    "1 teaspoon granulated sugar",
    "200 grams (about ¾ cup) sourdough discard (unfed, at room temperature)",
    "¾ cup warm water",
    "2 Tablespoons olive oil",
    "semolina flour (for dusting)"

  "instructions_list": [
    "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook*, combine bread flour, yeast, salt and granulated sugar. Mix to combine.",
    "Add sourdough discard. With the mixer on low speed, slowly pour in 3/4 cup of warm water and the olive oil. Increase speed to medium until a shaggy dough forms and wraps around the dough hook. If needed, add more flour or water (1 Tablespoon at a time) to reach your desired consistency.",
    "Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead for 2-3 minutes until a soft, smooth dough forms. The dough should not be sticky. Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.",
    "Preheat oven to 450°F. Lightly dust two baking sheets with semolina flour and set aside**.",
    "Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and divide in two equal-sized pieces. Shape each into a round and place on the prepared baking sheets. Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Gently press the dough to shape your crust into the desired shape and thickness. If you find the dough bouncing back and not holding shape, cover with a clean kitchen towel and let the dough rest for 10 minutes, then shape again. Add your favorite toppings, drizzle the curst with olive oil (optional) and bake for 20-30 minutes (see notes)."
